## Recent News

* The Fall schedule has been posted!  Workshops will be on the first Thursday of each month
  from 12:30 to 2pm, with a "lunch and learn" approach.  The first half hour will be for
  socializing, answering random R questions, sharing new ideas, etc.  Then, starting around 1pm,
  we'll get down to business with the session topic for that day.  We hope to have some type
  of food or treat, but still working on the details...

* We are looking to get more people (students, staff, & faculty) involved with planning and
  coordinating the R Working Group.  If you are interesetd, please let us know
