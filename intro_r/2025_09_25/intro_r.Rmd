# Welcome to the R Working Group

* Website [https://buckipr.github.io/R_Working_Group/](https://buckipr.github.io/R_Working_Group/)

  + we are Slackers(?) (email Jason at thomas.3912 for an invite)

--

* *New Theme*: Computational Demography
    
    + impacts of digitization on daily life, social interactions, where &
    what data are, capabilities of technology
    
    + taking us beyond "traditional" approach (e.g., inference from regressions
    using survey data)
    
--

* R & Computational Demography/Research?

--

  + closer to a general programming language
  
  + user community, extensions, & IDE


---
# Goals for this session

* Learn about...

--
    + basic R syntax
    
    + different R objects (things that hold data) & **indexing** them
    
    + general programming

--
  
* Become familiar with [R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) & 
  develop good coding habits 
  
--
  
    * R Studio is an *additional* program that provides many useful features
    for working with R
    
    * (you need to download and install both [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and 
    [R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/))

# R Studio


---
# R Studio

* Let's dive in by starting R Studio and opening a new R script

    + menu bar: &nbsp; `File` &rarr; `New File` &rarr; `R Script`
    + (in R: &nbsp; `File` &rarr; `New Script`)
--

* You should now have 4 panes open (like on the next slide)

    + **Source** -- Our script where we will type and save our comments & commands
    + **Console** -- Where we can give R commands and where the output will appear
    + **Output** -- File explorer, plots, help files, and more!
    + **Environments** -- Useful information about the R session

# R Studio: Good Habits

* Add a comment to our new script:
    ```{r, eval=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
    #------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # File name: first_r_script.R
    # last modified: 1843-09-13
    # (start comment with # and R ignores the rest of the line)
    #------------------------------------------------------------------------
    3 + 3 # this useful part is for humans (R will add & ignore the rest)
    ```
--

* Save our script

    + menu bar: &nbsp; `File` &rarr; `Save As...`
--

* Set our **working directory**

    + this is where R will start looking for & saving files (e.g., data files or plots)
    
    + menu bar: &nbsp; `Session` &rarr; `Set Working Directory` &rarr; <br>
    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `Choose Directory...`


---
class:slide-font-25
# R Studio: Terminal?

In the spirit of computational demography...

* We should (should we?) explore the Terminal
  
  + Console Pane in RStudio has multiple tabs, one of which is a Terminal

* Commands (e.g., `ls` and `pwd`) let you explore the file system on your
computer, make changes, and perform a few advanced tricks...

  + [tutorial](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/115010737148-Using-the-RStudio-Terminal-in-the-RStudio-IDE)
  
  + *advanced tricks* include: running multiple R scripts at the same time,
  searching a 100 files to see if (and where) the file includes a certain
  word or sentence

* Operating system is important, but R may try to minimize the differences

# Basic R


---
class:slide-font-25
# Basic R Syntax

* R syntax takes the form

```{r, eval=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
# object_name <- object_value  
mean_age <- 33
```

--

* The symbol "`<-`" is called the assignment operator

    + we are creating a new variable called `mean_age` and assigning it (a
    type and) a value of 33

    + `mean_age = 33` will also work (but `<-` is the convention)

--

* Useful keyboard shortcut to produce `<-`
    
    + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> (Windows)
    
    + <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> (Mac)

---
class: slide-font-25
# Basic R Syntax (cont.)

If we enter the name of a variable in the `Console`, then R will list the value(s)
```{r}
Mean_age <- 22  ## note: object names are case-sensitive
mean_age
Mean_age
```

--
BUT we are in the business of good habits...

* type this syntax into our script and (with the cursor on the same line) press the following keys together:

    + On a Mac: &nbsp;  <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>return</kbd>
    
    + In Windows: &nbsp; <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> &emsp; (in R Studio)  <br> 
    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &ensp; <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> &emsp; &emsp; &ensp; (in the R app)

* these keyboard shortcuts will run the syntax on the line in the `Console` <br> 
(or you can highlight a region)


---
class: slide-font-25
# Basic R Syntax: functions

We have seen a simple object for holding data, but R has many useful **functions**
```{r, eval=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
ls()                         # list all the objects in memory
rm(Mean_age)                 # remove the object called Mean_age2
rm(list=ls())                # deletes all objects (CAREFUL!!!)
getwd()                      # print the working directory (wd)
setwd("Thesis/Analysis")     # set the wd to the folder Thesis/Analysis
dir()                        # list the files in the current directory
dir("../")                   # list the files in the parent directory
save.image("my_data.RData")  # save all the objects in memory
# ???                        # what if you only want to save 1 thing??
load("my_data.RData")        # load all the objects in the data file
```

--

*Quick note*:

* suppose you create an object called `abc` that holds the value 2
* then you load `data.RData` that also has an object named `abc` but holds the value 99
* the first version of the object (`abc` holding 2) will get replaced


---
class: codefs-50
# Basic R Syntax: help files

* Google searches are a very effective way to find help

    + and so is asking the R Working Group `r emoji("sunglasses")`
--

* R documentation can be accessed in the `Help` tab in the `Output` pane

--

* Some additional syntax and functions

```{r, eval=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
?read.csv                     # show the help file for the function read.csv
help.search("weighted mean")  # search help files for the phrase 'weighted mean'
```

--

* What does the `save` function do, and how do you use it?

# Data Structures in R


---

## **Data Structures**: motivation

We are not going to solve the world's problems with a single number...

```{r}
all_ages <- c(22, 33, 44, 55)  # c() concatenates numbers together
all_ages
mean(all_ages)                 # calculate the mean
all_ed <- c("HS", "Col", "Grad Sch", "HS")
all_ed
```


---
## **Data Structures**: motivation (cont.)

R handles different *types* of data as well

```{r}
important_data <- c("OSU", "R", "Group", 4)
important_data
```


Wait, what is going on here?
--

* we are mixing different types of data & R assumes that we just forgot to
wrap the 4 in quotation marks
    
* sometimes R's assumptions are useful, sometimes they are not! `r emoji("thinking")`
    

---
## **Data Structures**: motivation (cont.)

Here is another example with missing data

```{r}
test_scores <- c(88, 99, 110, 66, NA)  # NA is for missing values
mean_scores <- mean(test_scores)
mean_scores / 100
```

 `r emoji("pouting_cat")` Ugh! Why didn't R tell me there was a problem when I tried to calculate the mean?!?

--
* another R assumption
    
* can you figure out how to calculate the mean for non-missing values? (help file
is helpful `r emoji("smile")`)


---
## **Data Structures**: vectors

* We have been creating **vectors** when we use `c()` to concatenate data

--

* Here are some more useful functions for working with vectors

```{r}
# test that we have a vector
is.vector(test_scores)  # returns another data type: TRUE or FALSE (called logical)
summary(test_scores)    # numerical summary (less helpful for strings)
```


---
## **Data Structures**: vectors (cont.)

```{r}
length(test_scores)     # how many elements in the vector
is.na(test_scores)      # test if each element is NA
TRUE + TRUE + FALSE     # useful trick with logical objects (TRUE/FALSE)
n_missing <- sum(is.na(test_scores))
n_missing
```



---
## **Data Structures**: indexing vectors

We can access the $i^{th}$ element in a vector with the syntax `vector_name[ i ]` 

```{r}
test_scores[1]    # first element
test_scores[2]    # second element
```

--
```{r}
1:3   # a vector of c(1, 2, 3)
      # so what will test_scores[3:1] give us?
```


---
## **Data Structures**: indexing vectors (cont.)


The syntax &ensp; `3:1` &ensp; gives the vector &ensp; `c(3, 2, 1)`, so...

--

```{r}
test_scores[3:1]  # returns 3rd element, then the 2nd, then the first
test_scores       # sanity check
```

--

* So what will the following command do? `r emoji("thinking")`

```{r, eval=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
test_scores[c(3, 5, 11)]
```


---
## **Data Structures**: changing vectors


We can use indexing to change vectors as well, e.g., reassign the first element

```{r}
test_scores[1]  <- NA # change the first element to NA
test_scores[1]
```

--

Again, we can use vectors to index as well:

```{r, eval=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
index_missing_scores <- is.na(test_scores)  # create an index vector of TRUE & FALSE
test_scores[index_missing_scores] <- -99    # change NA to -99
```

--

Let's walk through this... <br>
(`r emoji("owl")` but note a good habit would be to create a new vector,
`new_test_scores`, so we can retain the original data!)


---
class: slide-font-25
## **Data Structures**: changing vectors (cont.)

```{r}
# create an index vector of TRUE & FALSE
index_missing_scores <- is.na(test_scores)
index_missing_scores
```

--

```{r}
# attach these 2 vectors together as columns
cbind(index_missing_scores, test_scores)
```

--

* with &nbsp; `cbind` &nbsp; we are actually creating a new **data structure** called a **matrix**
--

* as we will see, matrices can only hold the same *data type*, so R changes `TRUE`/`FALSE`
to `1`/`0` (respectively)


---
## **Data Structures**: changing vectors (cont.)

```{r}
test_scores[index_missing_scores]  #  access all of the indices with TRUE 
```

--

```{r}
# recode NA to -99
test_scores[index_missing_scores] <- -99
test_scores
```

--

```{r}
# useful tool for finding the location/position of certain values
which(test_scores == -99)
```

---
## Strategy for changing vectors

When you want to change a vector, do the *delta 2-step*: 

1. create an index vector that identifies the elements you want to change 

    * what data type should this vector hold?
    * `logical`, i.e. `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s

2. assign new values to the vector using your vector of indices


---
## **Data Structures**: changing vectors (tips)

Create an index with multiple conditions

  + to satisfy BOTH conditions use `&` (and)
  + to satisfy EITHER condition use `|` (or)
    
```{r}
cbind(test_scores,
      test_scores > 0 & test_scores < 90,
      test_scores < 0 | test_scores > 90)
```


---
class: slide-font-25
## **Data Structures**: changing vectors (tips)

Check if values belong to a set with: `%in%`.  For example, here are
some letters

```{r}
letters[1:10]
```

We can check if characters (e.g. "1" or "b") are included in the vector `letters`
with:

```{r}
cbind(c("1", "g", "b", "&") ,
      c("1", "g", "b", "&") %in% letters)
```


---
## **Data Structures**: more than vectors

* We are not going to become `r emoji("moneybag")` famous `r emoji("moneybag")` by working with
a single vector

--

* However, we have learned a powerful way to work with vectors, **indexing**, that extends to
other types of **data structures**

--

* A **matrix** made a brief appearance earlier, but before going further let's review a useful framework
for thinking about **data structures**


---
## **Data Structures**: overview

R has different structures for holding data, which can be 
organized by... 

--
1. How many dimensions does the structure have? 

--

2. Do the types of data need to be the same?
  
--

* Example: **vectors**

    + only 1 dimension (it is just a single row or a column)
    
    + we saw earlier that R changes the elements so they all have
    the same data type (e.g., `4` &rarr; `"4"`)

--

We'll now (re)introduce different data structures, and learn about
different data types along the way.


---
## **Data Structures**: overview (cont.)

* **Vectors**
  1. 1 dimension
  1. same data type
    + special case: **factor** (predefined categories)

* **Matrices**
  1. rows and columns
  1. same data type

* **Arrays** 
  1. any number of dimensions
  1. same data type

---

## **Data Structures**: overview (cont.)

* **Data Frames**
  1. rows and columns
  1. different data types
  - particularly useful for holding a data set with quantitative & qualitative variables

* **Lists**
  1. 1 dimension
  1. different data types (or structures!)
  - actually, this is just a special type of vector (can you verify this?)


---
## **Data Structures**: working with data frames

* For the rest of this session we will focus on **Data frames**, the R structure
typically used for data sets (i.e., variables as columns and an observation for each row). 

--

* Let's get some practice working with data frames using one
of R's example data sets

```{r}
data(mtcars)            ## load one of R's example data sets mtcars
ls()
is.data.frame(mtcars)   ## check that mtcars is a data frame
```


---
## **Data Structures**: reading in data sets

Before we proceed with `mtcars`, a quick example of how to read in a data set.

```{r}
# write data to a CSV file called 'copy_mtcars.csv' in the working directory
write.csv(mtcars, "copy_mtcars.csv")      
mtcars2 <- read.csv("copy_mtcars.csv")  # load data set from CSV file
ls()
is.data.frame(mtcars2)
```

---
## **Data Structures**: exploring data frames

* Since **data frames** have 2 dimensions, the index requires 2 pieces of
info: `[row index, column index]`

```{r, collapse=TRUE}
dim(mtcars)
mtcars[1, 1]  # 1st observation in 1st variable
```

--

* Many times, however, we just work with one variable/column at a time, so all our skills
working with vectors still apply

```{r}
# if we leave out the row part of the address, we get all rows and a vector
is.vector(mtcars[, 1])
```



---
class: slide-font-25
## **Data Structures**: exploring data frames

* And now, some Old School techniques for working with data frames
* Access a single column in a data frame is to use `$`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
names(mtcars)  ## print the variable names
mtcars$mpg     ## return the mpg variable
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
options(width=70)
names(mtcars)  ## print the variable names
mtcars$mpg     ## return the mpg variable
```

--

* Now we will (re)introduce several functions for exploring data frames
* We will also see a more advanced example of indexing


---
## **Data Frames**: exploring columns (cont.)

```{r, prompt = TRUE}
dim(mtcars)    ## print the number of rows and columns
str(mtcars)    ## print structure of data frame
```


---
## **Data Frames**: summarizing columns

```{r, prompt = TRUE}
summary(mtcars)
```


---
## **Data Frames**: exploring columns (cont.)

An alternative ways to access a data frame's variable(s):

```{r, prompt=TRUE}
mtcars[["mpg"]]
mtcars[1:10, c("mpg", "cyl")]
```


---
## **Data Frames**: creating new variables

```{r, prompt=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mtcars$mpg_squared <- mtcars$mpg * mtcars$mpg
mtcars[1:10, c("mpg", "mpg_squared")]
```


---
## **Data Frames**: more on indexing

Recall that when creating an index, we can also use multiple conditions

 * to satisfy BOTH conditions use `&` (and)
 * to satisfy EITHER condition use `|` (or)
 
 

```{r}
mtcars[mtcars$mpg < 25 & mtcars$mpg > 21, c("mpg", "cyl")]
```


---
## **Data Frames**: more on indexing (cont.)

(remember: variables are just vectors, so we can use what we learned earlier)

```{r}
cbind(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$mpg < 15 | mtcars$mpg > 20)[1:10,]
```


---
## **Data Frames**: more on indexing (cont.)

And we can use multiple variables

```{r}
table(mtcars$mpg > 30 & mtcars$cyl == 6)
table(mtcars$mpg > 30 & mtcars$cyl == 4)
```


---
## **Data Frames**: final indexing example

```{r}
hi_mpg <- mtcars$mpg > mean(mtcars$mpg)
hi_cyl <- mtcars$cyl == 4
table(hi_mpg, hi_cyl)
```


---
## **Data Frames**: final indexing example (cont.)

```{r}
mtcars$good_car <- FALSE
mtcars$good_car[hi_mpg & hi_cyl] <- TRUE
table(mtcars$good_car)
```

---
## **Data Frames**: final indexing example (cont.)

Sanity check

```{r}
# cbind(mtcars$good_car, hi_mpg, hi_cyl, mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl)
cbind(mtcars$good_car, hi_mpg, hi_cyl)[1:15,]
```

# General Programming


---
## **General Programming**

* Coders often find themselves in the position of repeating blocks of
code (or similar blocks of code), or needing an existing tool to do
something a little different.

--

* For these situations we can turn to some more general features of
computer programming

  + `for` loops -- repeating the same steps, but for different
  variables/names/objects

  + functions -- creating your own tool that can take an object,
  manipulate the argument, and return something useful


---
## `for` loops: basic example

```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
  msg <- paste("Current index:", i, sep = " ")
  print(msg)
}
```


---
## `for` loops: data frame example

```{r}
mtcars[1:4,] <- NA
for (index_for_col in 1:ncol(mtcars)) {
  index_for_na <- is.na(mtcars[, index_for_col])
  mtcars[index_for_na, index_for_col] <- -99
}
mtcars
```


---
## `function`: basic example

```{r}
add_one <- function(x) {
  x_plus_one <- x + 1
  return(x_plus_one)
}
add_one(19)
```


---
## `function`: return a list (1st effort)

```{r}
my_summary <- function(x, remove_na = TRUE) {
  if (is.vector(x)) {
    return("Sorry, I only work with vectors.")
  }
  out <- list()
  out$mean <- mean(out, rm.na = remove_na)
  out$sd <- sd(out, na.rm = remove_na)
  out$median <- median(out, na.rm = remove_na)
  out$msg <- "This looks like a great variable!"
  return(msg)
}
x <- c(rnorm(20), NA, NA)
my_summary(x)
```

Can you fix this?

---
## `function`: return a list (2nd effort)

```{r}
my_summary <- function(x, remove_na = TRUE) {
  if (!is.vector(x)) {
    return("Sorry, I only work with vectors.")
  }
  out <- list()
  out$mean <- mean(x, na.rm = remove_na)
  out$sd <- sd(x, na.rm = remove_na)
  out$median <- median(x, na.rm = remove_na)
  out$msg <- "This looks like a great variable!"
  return(out)
}
x <- c(rnorm(20), NA, NA)
my_summary(x)
```

# More R Features


---
## **Additional topics**

* R Markdown & Dynamic Documents

    + [previous R session](https://buckipr.github.io/R_Working_Group/r_markdown/2024_09/intro_r_markdown_np.html#1)

* (More ways of) Integrating R with other software

    + Python:  [reticulate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reticulate/index.html)
    (several vignettes)
    
    + [Transition from Stata](https://buckipr.github.io/R_Working_Group/transition2R/transition2R.html)

* GitHub & RStudio


---
# Track Changes for Code

* [**GitHub**](https://github.com) is an on-line service for tracking the history of each file in your project
(i.e., **version control**)

   + each project is stored in a *repository*, which can be made public or private (so only you and
   your team can access the files)

  + [how much space?](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/what-is-my-disk-quota)

  + unlimited repositories (public and private); "abundant storage"; try to keep it under 1GB per repo

* Software: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (but also hooks into fancy IDEs like R Studio 
and VS Code)


---
# GitHub: additional features

* Branches -- a separate copy of every file in your repository; make changes and (if all goes well)
merge back with the main branch

    + useful for trying new code/tools that *might* work; sensitivity analysis, 
  
* You can host your own website through GitHub: [R Working Group](https://buckipr.github.io/R_Working_Group/)
  
* Extensive userbase -- easy to find help online and many tools/libraries/packages are hosted on GitHub
(help with errors and new features)

* Excellent for group projects!


---
class: slide-font-25
## GitHub: concepts and workflow

* Start by creating a repository on the GitHub website

* **clone** the repository -- creates a copy of all the files on your personal computer

* Make new files and changes to your local copies, then **stage** all the files you want to keep track of

* **commit** all of the files you have staged (you can also add a comment about what was done)

  + this creates a new version (or snap shot) of your project
  
  + you can go back and look at previous commits (or revert to that version) and look at differences between
  commits

* **push** your files to GitHub so that your on-line repository has the latest version of the files


---
## **Recap & Moving Forward**

* You should now be familiar with a few of R's data structures

  + (and for knowing when they should be used: # of dimensions & data types)
  
* We have also been introduced to some useful functions for manipulating, summarizing,
and exploring data

  + There are many more(!) and users contribute **R packages** that implement a wide
  range of tools, models, and methods: [list of some packages on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
  

---
## **Recap & Moving Forward** (cont.)

* R comes installed with many packages that you can explore & access with the `library()`
function

```r
# library()              # list all the packages installed on your computer
library(stats)           # load the stats package
# help(package="stats")  # look at the package documentation
```

* In future session, we will explore some of these packages that are particularly useful
for

    + data carpentry: [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
    + making plots: [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

* Please join us `r emoji("smile")`
