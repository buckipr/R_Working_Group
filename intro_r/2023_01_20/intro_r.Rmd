# Goals for this session

* Learn about...

--
    + basic R syntax
    
    + different R objects (things that hold data) & **indexing** them
    
    + useful functions for working with data

--
  
* Become familiar with [R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) & 
  develop good coding habits 
  
--
  
    * R Studio is an *additional* program that provides many useful features
    for working with R
    
    * (you need to download and install both [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and 
    [R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/))

# R Studio


---
# R Studio

* Let's dive in by starting R Studio and opening a new R script

    + menu bar: &nbsp; `File` &rarr; `New File` &rarr; `R Script`
    + (in R: &nbsp; `File` &rarr; `New Script`)
--

* You should now have 4 panes open (like on the next slide)

    + **Source** -- Our script where we will type and save our comments & commands
    + **Console** -- Where we can give R commands and where the output will appear
    + **Output** -- File explorer, plots, help files, and more!
    + **Environments** -- Useful information about the R session

# R Studio: Good Habits

* Add a comment to our new script:
    ```{r, eval=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
    # Comment: My R script from Working Group Session (1/20/2023)
    # (R ignores all lines that begin with a pound/hash/number sign/#)
    ```
--

* Save our script
    + menu bar: &nbsp; `File` &rarr; `Save As...`
--

* Set our **working directory**
    + this is where R will start looking for & saving files (e.g., data files or plots)
    + menu bar: &nbsp; `Session` &rarr; `Set Working Directory` &rarr; <br>
    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `Choose Directory...`

# Basic R Syntax

---
# Basic R Syntax

* R syntax takes the form

```{r, eval=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
# object_name <- object_value  
mean_age <- 33
```

--

* The symbol "`<-`" is called the assignment operator

    + we are creating a new variable called `mean_age` and assigning it a value of 33

    + `mean_age = 33` will also work (but `<-` is the convention)


---
class: slide-font-25
# Basic R Syntax (cont.)

If we enter the name of a variable in the `Console`, then R will list the value(s)
```{r}
Mean_age2 <- 22  ## note: object names are case-sensitive
Mean_age2
```

--
BUT we are in the business of good habits...

* type this syntax into our script and (with the cursor on the same line) press the following keys together:

    + On a Mac: &nbsp;  `<command> <enter>`
    
    + In Windows: &nbsp; `<control> <enter>` &emsp; (in R Studio)  <br> 
    &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `<control> r` &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &ensp; (in the R app)

* these keyboard shortcuts will run the syntax on the line in the `Console` <br> 
(or you can highlight a region)


---
# Basic R Syntax: functions

We have seen a simple object for holding data, but R has many useful **functions**
```{r, eval=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
ls()                         # list all the objects in memory
rm(Mean_age2)                # remove the object called Mean_age2
getwd()                      # print the working directory
dir()                        # list the files in the current directory
dir("../")                   # list the files in the parent directory
save.image("my_data.RData")  # save all the objects in memory
load("my_data.RData")        # load all the objects in the data file
```


--

*Quick note*:

* suppose you create an object called `abc` that holds the value 2
* then you load a file `data.RData` that also has an object named `abc` but holds the value 99
* the first version of the object (`abc` holding 2) will get replaced


---
# Basic R Syntax: help files

* Google searches are a very effective way to find help

    + and so is asking the R Working Group `r emoji("sunglasses")`
--

* R documentation can be accessed in the `Help` tab in the `Output` pane

--

* Some additional syntax and functions
```{r, eval=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
?read.csv                     # show the help file for the function read.csv
help.search("weighted mean")  # search help files for the phrase'weighted mean'
```

# Data Structures in R


---

## **Data Structures**: motivation

We are not going to solve the world's problems with a single number...

```{r}
all_ages <- c(22, 33, 44, 55)  # c() concatenates numbers together
all_ages
mean(all_ages)                 # calculate the mean
all_ed <- c("HS", "Col", "Grad Sch", "HS")
all_ed
```


---
## **Data Structures**: motivation (cont.)

R handles different *types* of data as well

```{r}
important_data <- c("OSU", "R", "Group", 4)
important_data
```


Wait, what is going on here?
--

* we are mixing different types of data & R assumes that we just forgot to
wrap the 4 in quotation marks
    
* sometimes R's assumptions are useful, sometimes they are not! `r emoji("thinking")`
    

---
## **Data Structures**: motivation (cont.)

Here is another example with missing data

```{r}
test_scores <- c(88, 99, 110, 66, NA)  # NA is for missing values
mean_scores <- mean(test_scores)
mean_scores / 100
```

 `r emoji("pouting_cat")` Ugh! Why didn't R tell me there was a problem when I tried to calculate the mean?!?

--
* another R assumption
    
* can you figure out how to calculate the mean for non-missing values? (help file
is helpful `r emoji("smile")`)


---
## **Data Structures**: vectors

* We have been creating **vectors** when we use `c()` to concatenate data

--

* Here are some more useful functions for working with vectors

```{r}
# test that we have a vector
is.vector(test_scores)  # returns another data type: TRUE or FALSE (called logical)
summary(test_scores)    # numerical summary (less helpful for strings)
```


---
## **Data Structures**: vectors (cont.)

```{r}
length(test_scores)     # how many elements in the vector
is.na(test_scores)      # test if each element is NA
TRUE + TRUE + FALSE     # useful trick with logical objects (TRUE/FALSE)
n_missing <- sum(is.na(test_scores))
n_missing
```



---
## **Data Structures**: indexing vectors

We can access the $i^{th}$ element in a vector with the syntax `vector_name[ i ]` 

```{r}
test_scores[1]    # first element
test_scores[2]    # second element
```

--
```{r}
1:3   # a vector of c(1, 2, 3)
      # so what will test_scores[3:1] give us?
```


---
## **Data Structures**: indexing vectors (cont.)


The syntax &ensp; `3:1` &ensp; gives the vector &ensp; `c(3, 2, 1)`, so...

--

```{r}
test_scores[3:1]  # returns 3rd element, then the 2nd, then the first
test_scores       # sanity check
```

--

* So what will the following command do? `r emoji("thinking")`

```{r, eval=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
test_scores[c(3, 5, 11)]
```


---
## **Data Structures**: changing vectors


We can use indexing to change vectors as well, e.g., reassign the first element

```{r}
test_scores[1]  <- NA # change the first element to NA
test_scores[1]
```

--

Again, we can use vectors to index as well:

```{r, eval=FALSE, prompt=FALSE}
index_missing_scores <- is.na(test_scores)  # create an index vector of TRUE & FALSE
test_scores[index_missing_scores] <- -99    # change NA to -99
```

--

Let's walk through this... <br>
(`r emoji("owl")` but note a good habit would be to create a new vector,
`new_test_scores`, so we can retain the original data!)


---
## **Data Structures**: changing vectors (cont.)

```{r}
# create an index vector of TRUE & FALSE
index_missing_scores <- is.na(test_scores)
index_missing_scores
```

--

```{r}
# attach these 2 vectors together as columns
cbind(index_missing_scores, test_scores)
```

--

* with &nbsp; `cbind` &nbsp; we are actually creating a new **data structure** called a **matrix**
--

* as we will see, matrices can only hold the same *data type*, so R changes `TRUE`/`FALSE`
to `1`/`0` (respectively)


---
## **Data Structures**: changing vectors (cont.)

```{r}
test_scores[index_missing_scores]  #  access all of the indices with TRUE 
```

--

```{r}
# recode NA to -99
test_scores[index_missing_scores] <- -99
test_scores
```


---
## **Data Structures**: changing vectors (recap)

When you want to change a vector, do the *delta 2-step*: 

1. create an index vector that identifies the elements you want to change 

    * what data type should this vector hold?
    * `logical`, i.e. `TRUE`s and `FALSE`s

2. assign new values to the vector using your vector of indices


---
## **Data Structures**: vector recap

* We are not going to become `r emoji("moneybag")` famous `r emoji("moneybag")` by working with
a single vector

--

* However, we have learned a powerful way to work with vectors, **indexing**, that extends to
other types of **data structures**

--

* A **matrix** made a brief appearance earlier, but before going further let's review a useful framework
for thinking about **data structures**


---
## **Data Structures**: overview

R has different structures for holding data, which can be 
organized by... 

--
1. How many dimensions does the structure have? 

--

2. Do the types of data need to be the same?
  
--


* Example: **vectors**

    + only 1 dimension (it is just a single row or a column)
    + we saw earlier that R changes the elements so they all have the same data type (e.g., `4` &rarr; `"4"`)

--

* We'll now (re)introduce different data structures, and learn about
different data types along the way.


---

## **Data Structures**: overview (cont.)

* **Vectors**
  1. 1 dimension
  1. same data type
    + special case: **factor** (predefined categories)

* **Matrices**
  1. rows and columns
  1. same data type

* **Arrays** 
  1. any number of dimensions
  1. same data type

---

## **Data Structures**: overview (cont.)

* **Data Frames**
  1. rows and columns
  1. different data types
  - particularly useful for holding a data set with quantitative & qualitative variables

* **Lists**
  1. 1 dimension
  1. different data types (or structures!)
  - actually, this is just a special type of vector (can you verify this?)


---
## **Data Structures**: working with data frames

* For the rest of this session we will focus on **Data frames**, the R structure
typically used for data sets (i.e., variables as columns and an observation for each row). 

--

* Let's get some practice working with data frames using one
of R's example data sets

```{r}
data(mtcars)            ## load one of R's example data sets mtcars
ls()
is.data.frame(mtcars)   ## check that mtcars is a data frame
```


---
## **Data Structures**: reading in data sets

Before we proceed with `mtcars`, a quick example of how to read in a data set.

```{r}
# write data to a CSV file called 'copy_mtcars.csv' in the working directory
write.csv(mtcars, "copy_mtcars.csv")      
mtcars2 <- read.csv("copy_mtcars.csv")  # load data set from CSV file
ls()
is.data.frame(mtcars2)
```

---
## **Data Structures**: exploring data frames

* Since **data frames** have 2 dimensions, the index requires 2 pieces of
info: `[row index, column index]`

```{r}
mtcars[1, 1]  # 1st observation in 1st variable
```

--

* Many times, however, we just work with one variable/column at a time, so all our skills
working with vectors still apply

```{r}
# if we leave out the row part of the address, we get all rows and a vector
is.vector(mtcars[, 1])
```


---
## **Data Structures**: exploring data frames

* A useful way to access a single column in a data frame is to use `$`

```{r}
names(mtcars)  ## print the variable names
mtcars$mpg     ## return the mpg variable
```

--

* Now we will (re)introduce several functions for exploring data frames
* We will also see a more advanced example of indexing



---
## **Data Frames**: exploring columns (cont.)

```{r, prompt = TRUE}
dim(mtcars)    ## print the number of rows and columns
str(mtcars)    ## print structure of data frame
```


---
## **Data Frames**: summarizing columns

```{r, prompt = TRUE}
summary(mtcars)
```


---
## **Data Frames**: exploring columns (cont.)

An alternative ways to access a data frame's variable(s):

```{r, prompt=TRUE}
mtcars[["mpg"]]
mtcars[, c("mpg", "cyl")]
```


---
## **Data Frames**: creating new variables

```{r, prompt=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
mtcars$mpg_squared <- mtcars$mpg * mtcars$mpg
mtcars[, c("mpg", "mpg_squared")]
```

---
## **Data Frames**: more on indexing

When creating an index, we can also use multiple conditions

 * to satisfy EITHER condition use `|` (or)
 * to satisfy BOTH conditions use `&` (and)
 

```{r}
mtcars$mpg > 20 | mtcars$mpg < 25
```


---
## **Data Frames**: more on indexing (cont.)

(remember: variables are just vectors, so we can use what we learned earlier)

```{r}
cbind(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$mpg < 20 | mtcars$mpg > 30)
```


---
## **Data Frames**: more on indexing (cont.)

And we can use multiple variables

```{r}
table(mtcars$mpg > 30 & mtcars$cyl == 6)
table(mtcars$mpg > 30 & mtcars$cyl == 4)
```


---
## **Data Frames**: final indexing example

```{r}
hi_mpg <- mtcars$mpg > mean(mtcars$mpg)
hi_cyl <- mtcars$cyl == 4
table(hi_mpg, hi_cyl)
```


---
## **Data Frames**: final indexing example (cont.)

```{r}
mtcars$good_car <- FALSE
mtcars$good_car[hi_mpg & hi_cyl] <- TRUE
table(mtcars$good_car)
```

---
## **Data Frames**: final indexing example (cont.)

Sanity check

```{r}
# cbind(mtcars$good_car, hi_mpg, hi_cyl, mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl)
cbind(mtcars$good_car, hi_mpg, hi_cyl)
```


---
## **Recap & Moving Forward**

* You should now be familiar with a few of R's data structures

  + (and for knowing when they should be used: # of dimensions & data types)
  
* We have also been introduced to some useful functions for manipulating, summarizing,
and exploring data

  + There are many more(!) and users contribute **R packages** that implement a wide
  range of tools, models, and methods: [list of some packages on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
  

---
## **Recap & Moving Forward** (cont.)

* R comes installed with many packages that you can explore & access with the `library()`
function

```r
# library()              # list all the packages installed on your computer
library(stats)           # load the stats package
# help(package="stats")  # look at the package documentation
```

* In future session, we will explore some of these packages that are particularly useful
for

    + data manipulation: [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
    
    + plotting: [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

* Please join us `r emoji("smile")`
