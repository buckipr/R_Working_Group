# Introduction to R

This version of the R Intro is a bit different (from past iterations),
as we tried to simultaneously introduce both the R language and R Markdown.
We started by going through the
[slides](https://buckipr.github.io/R_Working_Group/intro_r/2025_01_24/r_intro_np.html#1)
then started working through the R markdown file included in the folder
(`rmarkdown.Rmd`).  It was probably a bit too much (and is better suited
for 2 sessions).


The R markdown files used to create the slides are also included in
case there are some interesting/useful features for those making
HTML slides.  To generate the presentation, you need
to install the excellent package [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)
(and maybe some others: knitr, emoji, dplyr, DT).
