# Introduction to R

These slides offer a basic introduction to [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and
[R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), while assuming no
previous experience.  The basic R syntax is covered, along with a description of
data structures, manipulating data, and using
[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/).  To generate the presentation, you need
to install the excellent package [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)
(and maybe some others: knitr, emoji, dplyr, DT).


A few updates were made from the previous version.

* added and modified a few slides (a bit more on dplyr, improved
the visualization of data output on one of the slides using DataTables
* added a bit more to the style file to change font size of code chunks
