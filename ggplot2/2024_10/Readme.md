# Introduction to ggplot2

These slides offer a basic introduction to [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
and make use of some additional packages for handling colors and plot layout

* tidyverse (which includes ggplot2)
* viridis
* RColorBrewer
* gridExtra


To generate the presentation, you need to install the excellent package [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)
(and maybe some others: knitr, emoji, dplyr, DT).
