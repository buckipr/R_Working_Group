# Introduction

* The goal for today is to learn how to extract data from website using R

  + to get there, we will have to learn a little bit about the structure & language of webpages (i.e., HTML, CSS)
  
      - no previous knowledge of HTML or CSS is assumend
  
  + [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) (tidyverse family): R package that will do most of the work

* [https://github.com/buckipr/R_Working_Group/webscraping](https://github.com/buckipr/R_Working_Group/webscraping)
<br> (slides)
  + Getting most of the material from Hadley Wickham's excellent book (ch. 24):
  [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/webscraping)

# Preliminary Step

Before we start looking at cool websites...

--

* Can you scrape data?

# Preliminary Step

Before we start looking at cool websites...

* Can you scrape data? probably 

--

* `r emoji("thinking")` **Should** you scrape data from a particular website?

--

  + are the data private? did you have to create an account to access them?
  
  + is there a "terms of service"? is a copyright involved?
  
  + do the data contain personally identifiable information?

--

* If any of these apply, then you should do some research to see if scraping these data is legal.

--

  + If they don't apply, then you should do some research to see if scraping these data is legal.


---
# Overview

Two buckets: "APIs" and non-APIs

--

* (**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface) -- how software communicates with the outside world
  
  + Some APIs are specifically intended for providing data in useful formats (e.g. CSV or JSON)
  + examples: Twitter, YouTube, Facebook

--

* Why does this matter?  It is much easier to extract data from an API and different tools are used
  + API: packages `httr` and `jsonlite`
  + No API `r emoji("weary")` then go with `rvest`

# HTML


---
# HTML: *big picture*

* **H**yper **Text** **M**arkup **L**anguage

  + different **elements** tell web browsers how to display text, images, structures, etc.
  + paragraph: `<p> This is a paragraph </p>`
  + table: `<table>` stuff, stuff, stuff `</table>`

--

* Web scraping involves searching through the elements in an HTML file to
find the data you want to use

  + `rvest` has a lot of tools for this

--

* Web browsers have a feature (developer tools) that is also very helpful
for seeing where/how the HTML elements appear on a page



---
# HTML: *example 1*

Open an HTML file (or text file) in R Studio (text editor) and enter the
following content

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
<title> My First Page </title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Example Heading</h1>
<p> <i>Hello</i> R Working Group!</p>
<p> Welcome to the session on web scraping.</p>
<p> p.s. R Rocks!!!!</p>
</body>

</html> 
```

After saving the file (with an `.html` extension), open it in your favorite
browser.  (Can you find the text "My First Page"?)


---
# HTML: *elements*

* The **elements** in example 1 contain text surrounded by **tags**

  + `<h1>` (start tag) & `</h1>` (end tag)
  
--

* **Block tags** are used to define sections and structure in a web page.
Here are some common examples:
  + `<h1>` Heading 1 `</h1>`  (with `<h2>`, ..., & `<h6>` for smaller sizes)
  + `<section>` & `</section>`
  + `<p>` paragraph `</p>`
  + `<table>` (has more tags for rows and headers) `<table>`
  + `<ul>` unordered list `</ul`> & `<li>` list item `</li>`
  + `<ol>` ordered list `</ol>`


---
# HTML: *elements* (cont.)

* There are also **inline tags** used for tasks like formatting text and adding links

  + `<b>` bold `</b>`, `<i>` italics `</i>`, and more
  + `<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html>` <br>
  link text appearing on web page <br>
  `</a>`
  
--

* Tags can also have **attributes**, which are useful for helping `rvest`
find the specific part of a web page you would like to scrape.

  + `id` and `class` are commonly used attributes
  + they appear inside the `< >` of the start tag


---
# HTML: *example 2*

Example with unordered list

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
<title>Largest Cities</title>
</head>

<body>
<h3>Largest Citites</h3>

<p id='top5'> Here are the top 5 cities with the largest population: </p>

<!-- comment: unordered list -->
<ul>
  <li> <span class='asia'> Tokyo (37,115,035) </span> </li>
  <li> <span class='asia'> Delhi (33,807,403) </span> </li>
  <li> <span class='asia'> Shanghi (29,867,918) </span> </li>
  <li> <span class='asia'> Dhaka (23,935,652) </span> </li>
  <li> <span class='latam'> Sao Paulo (22,806,704) </span> </li>
</ul>

</body>
</html> 
```

---
# HTML: *example 3*

Now lets add some structure by including a table

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
<title>Powerful Corporations</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>U.S. Companies</h1>
<p>These companies are worth a lot of cash and should be studied.</p>
<br><br><br><br><br>

 <table>
  <tr>                         <!-- start a table row -->
    <th>Company</th>           <!-- table header -->
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Country</th>
  </tr>                        <!-- end a table row -->
  <tr>
    <td>Microsoft</td>  <! -- table data -->
    <td>$3.187 trillion</td>
    <td>USA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Jason Inc.</b></td>
    <td>$2.932 trillion</td>
    <td>USA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Apple</td>
    <td>$2.692 trillion</td>
    <td>USA</td>
  </tr>
</table> 

</body>
</html> 
```

# HTML: *elements & style*

* References & resources on elements:

  + [MDN -- elements and more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
  + [W3 Schools -- elements](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)
  + [W3 Schools -- try it out](https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_basic_document)

--

* **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets (CSS) is a popular way to systematically set the style for web pages.

  + styling is implemented via **selectors** such as `tag` names or attributes like `id` & `class`
  + (for a given selector `property:value;` sets how the element is displayed)

* Let's see an example using an "external" css file

---
# CSS: *example 4*

Open a new CSS file in R Studio (or text file with the .css extension) and insert the following

```
/* comment: example of tag selectors */
p {
  color: red;           /* the text in all paragraphs will now be red */
  text-align: center;
}

h3, h4 {
  color: orange;
  background-color: green;
}

/* example id selector -- only for a single element (id's must be unique) */
#blue_par {
  color: blue;
}

/* example class selector -- for a group of the same elements */
.brown_par {
  color: brown;
}
```

---
# HTML: *example 4*

Style the following HTML

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
<title>Example 4</title>
<link rel='stylesheet' href="example-04.css">
</head>

<body>
<h1>Header 1 (normal)</h1>
<p> This text should be red and centered because we used the tag name <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</p>

This text is not inside a paragraph, so it is not center aligned.

<h2>Header 2 (normal)</h2>
<p id='blue_par'>This text should be blue and centered since we used the id attribute.</p>

<h3>Header 3 (styled)</h3>
<p class='brown_par'>This text should be brown and centered.</p>

<h4>Header 4 (styled)</h4>
<p class='brown_par'>This text should also be brown and centered.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

# HTML: recap

HTML is a language that uses elements to create web pages

* elements are demarcated with tags: `<h1>` & `</h1>`

* tags can also have attributes, e.g., `id` & `class`
  + `<p id = "par_id">` & `</p>`
  + `<h1 class='my_header1'>` & `</h1>`

--

* Web scraping involves searching through the elements, tags, & attributes in an HTML file to
find the data you want to use.

  + `rvest` has a lot of tools for this, so let's take it for a spin


---
class: inverse, center, middle

# `rvest`


---
# `rvest`: *big picture*

`rvest` will allow us to accomplish a lot with only a few functions that navigate HTML
and extract data

--

* `read_html("http://mypage.org")` -- read in HTML from web address (or local file) and store it as an `xml_document`
  + `xml` is another language used to organize data

--

* Find elements with:  `html_elements()` & `html_element()`
  + these are typically used in tandem to create variables and fill in observations


---
# `rvest`: *big picture* (cont.)

* `html_text2()` -- pull out the text from an element (and strip out any extra HTML)

* `html_table()` -- extract tables

* `html_attr()` -- extract attributes


---
# `rvest`: simple example

```{r simple_example}
library(rvest)
dir()

example01 <- read_html("example-01.html")
example01
```

The page is stored as 2 elements, so we need `rvest` tools to do the un-nesting.


---
class: slide-font-25
# `rvest`: simple example (cont.)


```{r simple_example_cont_a}
## let's rvest out the paragraphs
example01 |> html_elements("p")
```

Here we see the `xml_nodeset` which can (and does!) have nested elements.

```{r simple_example_cont_b}
## no s!
example01 |> html_element("p")
```

Just showing the difference here (when an html_doc is passed to `html_element()` it returns the first
match)


---
class: slide-font-25
# `rvest`: simple example (cont.)

Now we'll strip out all the tags (that aren't useful for our research)...

```{r simple_example_cont2_a}
example01 |> html_elements("p") |>
  html_text2()
```

`r emoji("celebrate")``r emoji("cake")``r emoji("celebrate")` Woo-hoo!!  We've got data. Now on to
the text analysis...


---
# `rvest`: `html_elements` & co.

Hadley Wickham's book ([R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/webscraping#nesting-selections),
ch. 24) has an awesome example showing how to use `html_elements()` & `html_element()` to work
with nested elements.

We will now take a look at this example...


---
# `rvest`: `html_elements()` & co.

Example from Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/webscraping#nesting-selections)
(ch 24.)

```{r wickham_24_1}
html <- minimal_html("
  <ul>
    <li><b>C-3PO</b> is a <i>droid</i> that weighs <span class='weight'>167 kg</span></li>
    <li><b>R4-P17</b> is a <i>droid</i></li>
    <li><b>R2-D2</b> is a <i>droid</i> that weighs <span class='weight'>96 kg</span></li>
    <li><b>Yoda</b> weighs <span class='weight'>66 kg</span></li>
  </ul>
  ")
html
```

`minimal_html()` is a tool for creating in-line HTML


---
# `rvest`: `html_elements()` & co.

Example from Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/webscraping#nesting-selections)
(ch 24.)

```{r wickham_24_2}
characters <- html |> html_elements("li")
characters
characters |> html_element("b")
```



---
# `rvest`: `html_elements()` & co.

Example from Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/webscraping#nesting-selections)
(ch 24.)

```{r wickham_24_3}
characters
characters |> html_element(".weight")
```


---
# `rvest`: `html_elements()` & co.

Example from Wickham's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/webscraping#nesting-selections)
(ch 24.)

```{r wickham_24_4a}
characters |> 
  html_element("b") |> 
  html_text2()
```

```{r wickham_24_4b}
characters |> 
  html_element(".weight") |> 
  html_text2()
```



---
# `rvest`: `html_attr()`

Now some practice selecting `class` attribute from example 2 (list of cities).

```{r example_02_1}
html2 <- read_html("example-02.html")
html2 |> html_elements("li")
```

---
# `rvest`: `html_attr()` (cont.)

We can get the data...


```{r example_02_2}
html2 |> html_elements("li") |>
  html_element("span") |>
  html_text2()
```

but attribute data could be useful as well (for a group indicator)


---
# `rvest`: `html_attr()`


```{r example_02_3a}
html2 |> html_elements("li") |>
  html_element("span") |>
  html_attr("class")
```

```{r example_02_3b}
data.frame("City" = html2 |> html_elements("span") |> html_text2(),
           "Region" = html2 |> html_elements("span") |> html_attr("class"))
```

(a little more work is needed to separate city name and pop size)


---
# `rvest`: `html_table()`

Next we'll turn to the table created in example 3

```{r example_03_1}
html3 <- read_html("example-03.html")
html3 |> html_table()
```

* Note that the output is actually a `list`.  If there were 3 tables in the HTML, we would get a
`list` of length 3.

* Convince yourself of this by adding more tables to `example-03.html` and scraping the data from
each table.


---
# `rvest`: `html_table()` (cont.)


```{r example_03_2}
tables_ex03 <- html3 |> html_table()
tab1_ex03 <- as.data.frame(tables_ex03[[1]])
tab1_ex03
```


---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Examples from the Web


---
# Copa Libertadores

* The obvious place to start is the Copa Libertadores!

  + as provided by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Copa_Libertadores_finals)
  
  
* Let's try to scrape data from the table to create a data frame with the variables:
  + year
  + winner & winner's country
  + runner-up & runner-up's country
  + score
  + venue


---
# Copa Libertadores (cont.)

```{r html_copa_lib}
html_copa <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Copa_Libertadores_finals")
```

This example is actually pretty easy `r emoji("blush")`.  Can you figure it out?



---
# Examples from the Web

* Now that we have some simple examples under out belt, let's tackle some harder tasks

  + Wickham's book provides another [excellent example](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/webscraping#starwars)
  that is somewhat gentle and fun (if you like lightsabers)

* When we jump into the real world, it is extremely useful to get familiar with a web browser's
developer tool

  + Highlight some text on the page that you are interested in, right-click, and select `Inspect`
  + Firefox: Tools &rarr; Browser Tool &rarr; Web Developer Tools
  + Chrome: View &rarr; Developer &rarr; Developer Tools


---
# Web Browser's Developer Tools

* The Developer Tools give a structured view of the webpage's HTML

  + a panel should open with the actual HTML so you can simultaneously see the code and how the browser displays it

--

* Even more cool is when you move the cursor over the HTML code, the browser will try to 
show you the corresponding part of the web page that the HTML produces

--

* As you will see, web pages can have A LOT of HTML with a ton of elements!  So the primary challenge
is finding the right element you want to scrape from.

  + this requires traversing through many nested elements
